##Rewrite position: 3

##Overview (Uploaded from personal Git server)
Project in my first year of university, a map that shows directions to users between campuses/buildings and even specific rooms. Needs one hell of a rewrite.


##Changes to make:
1. Complete UI/UX overhaul 
2. Login page?
3. Improve overall code (repetitive, outdated, etc.)
